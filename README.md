# Niva – A Modern Social Media Application

Niva is a complete social media platform where users can upload posts, share stories, 
watch loop videos (similar to reels), and chat in real time.
I built this project to improve my MERN stack skills and to learn how real-time social media 
systems work using **Socket.io**.

``` The main focus was to create a smooth, modern, and interactive experience — just like an actual social media app. ```

Whenever someone likes or comments on a post or loop, it appears immediately for all users without refreshing the page.

Notifications for likes, comments update instantly.
